2-Pane for Google Reader
========================
A browser extension tuning Google Reader with two-pane navigation - easily
switch between two-pane and regular navigation with a toggle switch.

Overview
------------------------

Anyone with a netbook, ultraportable, or other computing device with low 
vertical resolution can testify to the nightmare of the new design changes
introduced to Google Reader.  Even with the selectable density trimming the user
interface's obese whitespace, my favorite RSS reader can now only display a
single article at a time.

Enter 2-Pane, a browser extension that makes more room for articles by
converting Google Reader into a two-pane navigation scheme.  Simply install and
enjoy browsing google reader with 135 more pixels devoted to vertical space.  To
access controls hidden in 2-Pane mode, click the popup and click "Original".


Features
-------------------------

* 2-Pane Mode: a two-pane interface for Google Reader maximizing vertical space.
* Original Mode: Toggle easily between the original interface and 2-Pane.


Installation
-------------------------

Just install the extension from the Chrome Web Store.

Be sure to press "r" after entering 2-Pane Mode.
